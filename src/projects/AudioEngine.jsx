              The Real-Time Audio Engine is a high-performance multithreaded
              audio system built in C++. Designed for gaming and simulation
              environments, it enables precise, low-latency playback and
              manipulation of audio assets.

                Built using XAudio2 with custom audio buffers, filters, and
                effect chains.
              </li>
              <li>
                Capable of streaming, queuing, pausing, resuming, and looping

              This engine was tested with various WAV files, 3D positional
              effects, and real-time audio mixing. It serves as a foundation for
              immersive soundscapes in interactive systems.
